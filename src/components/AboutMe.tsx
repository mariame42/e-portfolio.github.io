              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                My journey into programming began as a student at 42 Abu Dhabi. Eight months ago, I began my coding journey with no prior experience, and through hands-on projects, hackathons, and peer learning, I have developed strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of programming. 
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                Through rigorous projects and collaborative challenges, I've developed not only technical skills but also critical soft skills such as time management, communication, and resilience in the face of complex problems.

                I aim to leverage my education at 42 Abu Dhabi to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry, particularly in areas of software innovation that address real-world challenges. I'm especially interested in exploring the intersection of technology and sustainability.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                My immediate goal is to secure an internship that allows me to apply my skills in a professional setting while continuing to grow as a developer and problem-solver.
